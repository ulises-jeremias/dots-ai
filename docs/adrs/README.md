# Architecture Decision Records

This directory tracks major architectural decisions for `dots-ai`.

> [!NOTE]
> ADRs are immutable once accepted. If a decision is revisited, write a new ADR that **supersedes** the original rather than editing it.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated
- **Context**: The situation and constraints that led to this decision
- **Decision**: What was decided, with key factors
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts
