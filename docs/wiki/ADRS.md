# Architecture Decision Records

> Tracking significant architectural decisions for the workstation platform.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document the **context**, **decision**, and **consequences** of significant technical choices. They provide a historical record of why things are the way they are.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title** — short descriptive name
2. **Status** — Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
3. **Context** — why the decision was needed
4. **Decision** — what was decided
5. **Consequences** — positive and negative outcomes

---

## When to write an ADR

- Adding a new major component or tool
- Changing a fundamental architecture pattern
- Making a decision that's hard to reverse
- Choosing between significant alternatives
