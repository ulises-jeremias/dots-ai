# Address GitHub PR Comments

Find the open PR for the current branch and walk through its review/conversation
comments using `gh`. Pair with [`github-cli-workflow`](../github-cli-workflow/SKILL.md)
when you also need to push changes or update the PR description.

## When to use

- The current branch has an open PR and reviewers left comments.
- The user asks to "address comments", "resolve review threads", or "respond to PR feedback".
- You need a summarized view of inline comments + reviews + conversation threads in one call.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` (GitHub CLI) installed and on `PATH` (covered by `dots-bootstrap`).
- `gh auth status` exits 0. If not, ask the user to run `gh auth login` once
  (workflow + repo scopes recommended).
- `python3` (used by the bundled inspection script).

`dots-doctor` already reports `gh auth status` under "Integrations" — confirm it
is green before invoking this skill.

## Workflow

1. **Verify auth.** Run `gh auth status`. If it fails, stop and ask the user to
   re-authenticate.
2. **Resolve the PR.** Use `gh pr view --json number,url,title` to confirm a PR
   is associated with the current branch. If none, surface that and stop.
3. **Fetch all threads in one pass.** Run the bundled script:

   ```bash
   python3 ~/.local/share/dots-ai/skills/gh-address-comments/scripts/fetch_comments.py \
     > /tmp/pr-comments.json
   ```

   The script paginates conversation comments, review submissions, and inline
   review threads (including resolved/outdated state) via `gh api graphql`.
4. **Summarize for the user.** Number every thread/comment and provide a one-line
   intent for each (e.g. `[3] tests/foo.test.ts:12 — reviewer asks for a null check`).
5. **Ask which to address.** Wait for the user to pick numbers before changing code.
6. **Apply fixes.** For each accepted comment, edit the relevant file and stage the
   change. Do not push or merge from this skill — delegate to `github-cli-workflow`.
7. **Optional: reply or resolve.** Once the user confirms, you can post replies
   with `gh pr comment <pr> --body "..."` or resolve threads via the GraphQL
   `resolveReviewThread` mutation when explicitly requested.

## Boundaries

- This skill **reads** PR feedback and **edits files**; it does **not** push,
  merge, or change PR metadata. Use `github-cli-workflow` for those steps.
- Scope is the open PR for the **current branch**. For arbitrary PR numbers,
  ask the user to switch branches first.
- If `gh` hits rate limits or auth errors mid-run, stop and surface the message —
  do not silently retry.

## Bundled resources

- `scripts/fetch_comments.py` — paginated GraphQL fetch (stdlib only, shells out
  to `gh api graphql`). Output is a single JSON document on stdout.

## Validation

- `dots-skills check` reports the `gh` requirement.
- `dots-doctor` shows `gh auth status` under Integrations.
