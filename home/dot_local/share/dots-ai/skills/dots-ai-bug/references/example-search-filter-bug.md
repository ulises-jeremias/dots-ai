# BUG-042: Search results not displaying after deployment

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to `/products` with query parameter `?category=electronics&sort=price_asc`
2. Click on the "Filter" button to open the filter panel
3. Select "Screen Size: 40-50 inch" and click Apply
4. Observe the results area

## Expected Result

Product grid updates to show only electronics with screen sizes between 40 and 50 inches, sorted by price ascending. Total count shows "47 products found".

## Actual Result

Results area shows a spinner indefinitely. Network tab shows 200 response but no DOM updates. After 30 seconds the spinner is replaced with an empty state: "No products match your filters."
