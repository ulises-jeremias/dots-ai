## Minutes

### Discussion Points

**Sprint Review:**
- Squad 3 completed 18 story points; 2 items rolled over
- Squad 4 delivered the search performance fix ahead of schedule
- Ben noted that deployment tooling caused a 15-minute delay on the staging release

**Blocker Escalation — Payment Gateway:**
- David presented queue depth metrics: 4,200 messages pending, consumer running at 60% capacity
- Risk: message age could exceed SLA if consumer does not scale within 48 hours
- Decision: Scale consumer to 3 replicas immediately; monitor for 24 hours

**Architecture Review — Service Decomposition:**
- Carmen presented proposal to split monolith into 5 bounded contexts
- Team discussed boundaries and data ownership
- Open question: should the search domain be independently deployable?
- Action: Carmen to create ADR with three options (monolith-first, search extraction, full decomposition)

**Confluence Migration:**
- Notion being deprecated as team wiki in favor of new Confluence instance
- Migration scheduled for Feb 5–9
- All teams need to review their pages and update links

### Decisions Made

- Payment consumer scaled to 3 replicas (immediate effect)
- Search domain decomposition ADR to be drafted by Carmen (due: Jan 26)
- Confluence migration: all page owners notified by Alice by Jan 26
