# Meeting Minutes (WHAT)

Use for meeting notes, validation meetings, or AI-assisted transcript summarization.

## Default guardrails

1. Apply **`dots-ai-output-handshake`** before final output.
2. Redact PII and sensitive details before finalizing.
3. Keep minutes concise and actionable.
4. Extract action items, owners, due dates, and linked task IDs when available.
5. Use **`clickup-cli`** to create follow-up tasks only after user approval.
