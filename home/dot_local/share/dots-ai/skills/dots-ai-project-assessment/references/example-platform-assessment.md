- Human reviewer: VP Engineering
- Assessment status: Reviewed

## Assessment Summary

- Assessment purpose: Quarterly health check for Platform Engineering unit
- Assessment period: 2024-01-01 to 2024-03-31
- Assessment scope: Platform team (4 engineers), 14 repositories, 2 production services
- Units assessed: Technical — Platform Engineering
- Overall health: 3.8 / 5 — Strong delivery with documented risk areas
- Key strengths: CI/CD coverage, code review culture, incident response speed
- Key risks or gaps: Documentation freshness, decision traceability to work items
- Overall confidence level: High

## Method

- Evidence sources used: GitHub repos, Linear, Datadog, Confluence, 6 engineer interviews
- Interviews or validation sessions: 6 structured interviews (Jan 15-17); all squad leads validated findings
- Indicators in scope: Standard technical indicators plus AI-Native Structural Readiness
- Indicators out of scope: Mobile-specific, data engineering (separate assessments)
- Scoring scale: 1 to 5 maturity scale
- Weighting approach, if any: Equal weight across indicators; maturity scale 1=ad-hoc, 5=optimized

## Unit Scorecards

### Unit: Platform Engineering

- Unit type: Technical
- Scope: Core platform services (API gateway, message queue infrastructure, deployment tooling)
- Evidence confidence: High

| Category | Indicator | Score | Confidence | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General Technical | Code quality | 4 | High | PR review samples, GitHub insights | Consistent style; some tech debt in legacy modules |
| General Technical | Deployment tools | 4 | High | GitHub Actions, Datadog deploy events | All automated; rollback tested |
| General Technical | Development experience | 4 | High | DX survey results, interview feedback | Onboarding doc adequate; local env setup takes ~2hrs |
| General Technical | Monitoring and observability | 5 | High | Datadog dashboards | Comprehensive; P50/P95/P99 visible |
| General Technical | Security awareness | 3 | Medium | Dependabot alerts, SAST results | Alerts triaged weekly; no automated DAST in pipeline |
| General Technical | Technical debt volume | 3 | High | GitHub debt analysis, interviews | Known items tracked in backlog; not actively reduced |
| General Technical | Workflow definition | 4 | High | Linear + Notion | DoR/DoD defined; mostly followed |
| General Technical | Testing | 3 | Medium | Test coverage reports, CI runs | ~68% coverage; unit tests strong, integration weak |
| Infrastructure | CI/CD | 4 | High | GitHub Actions logs | All repos CI; staging deploys automated, prod manual |
| Infrastructure | Infrastructure as Code | 4 | High | Terraform configs in repo | All infra in Terraform; drift detection enabled |
| Infrastructure | Secrets management | 4 | High | Vault + GitHub secrets | No hardcoded secrets; rotation policy documented |
| Infrastructure | Incident response | 4 | High | INC log, Datadog alerts | Median time to acknowledge: 8 min; P95 resolution: 2.4 hrs |
| AI-Native | Codebase explicitness | 4 | High | Repo structure, docs | Clear layering; README in each repo |
| AI-Native | Deterministic build | 4 | High | CI logs, Docker builds | Builds reproducible; cache hit rate >80% |
| AI-Native | Observability | 4 | High | Datadog + logging | Structured logs; trace IDs across services |
| AI-Native | Testability | 3 | Medium | Test coverage + patterns | Unit tests strong; integration test gaps |
| AI-Native | Dependency transparency | 3 | Medium | Dependabot, SBOM | Dependencies tracked; SBOM not auto-generated |

## Findings

### Strengths

- Finding: CI/CD pipeline is mature and reliable across all 14 repositories.
  - Evidence: GitHub Actions covers 100% of repos; all have automated tests; staging deploy automated
  - Confidence: High

- Finding: Incident response is fast and well-documented.
  - Evidence: Median acknowledge time 8 min; all postmortems within 48 hrs; action items tracked
  - Confidence: High

### Risks and Gaps

- Finding: Documentation is not kept in sync with code changes.
  - Evidence: 5 of 12 Confluence pages reviewed were last updated before relevant code change
  - Impact: Onboarding time is higher than it should be; engineers report spending time tracing actual behavior
  - Confidence: Medium

- Finding: ADRs are not linked to Linear work items, breaking traceability.
  - Evidence: 7 ADRs exist in Notion; zero cross-references to tasks or PRs
  - Impact: Cannot trace architectural decision to implementation or验证 decision rationale
  - Confidence: Medium

### Missing Evidence

- Evidence needed: Direct product team satisfaction for platform reliability
  - Why it matters: Stakeholder satisfaction indicator currently relies on indirect signals
  - Suggested source or owner: PM lead to provide 1:1 feedback from product stakeholders

## Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Rationale | Owner | Suggested follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | Implement doc-on-code policy: README or Confluence update required with architectural changes | Docs freshness directly impacts onboarding and AI assistant context quality | Carmen Reyes | Create checklist item in PR template |
| Medium | Link ADRs to Linear tasks using custom field | Restore traceability; enable future AI-assisted decision retrieval | Elena Vasquez | Add `adr_link` field to Linear task template |
| Low | Add DAST to CI pipeline | Security indicator below target; easy automation | David Park | Evaluate OWASP ZAP GitHub Action |

## Action Plan Candidates

- [ ] Update Confluence pages for API gateway and message queue (Owner: Carmen, Due: 2024-04-15)
- [ ] Add ADR link field to Linear work item template (Owner: Alice, Due: 2024-04-01)
- [ ] Evaluate DAST integration (Owner: David, Due: 2024-05-01)

## Assumptions and Limitations

- Assumption: Confluence page timestamps reflect actual content freshness (not just metadata edits)
- Limitation: Stakeholder feedback relies on quarterly NPS; no real-time signal for platform-specific issues

## Approval

- Reviewed by: Elena Vasquez, VP Engineering
- Review date: 2024-03-28
- Approval notes: Assessment approved with action items prioritized. Elena to review progress in June check-in.
