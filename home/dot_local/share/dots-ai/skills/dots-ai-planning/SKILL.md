# Planning and Estimation (WHAT)

Use this skill when work needs planning, breakdown, estimation, or capacity validation before it becomes final backlog content.

## Default guardrails

1. Apply **`dots-ai-output-handshake`** before producing any final planning artifact: ask where it should live and confirm human review.
2. Prefer project-specific planning rules if the repo, ticket system, or engagement pack defines them. Otherwise use this default.
3. If a work item is being created or refined, pair this with **`dots-ai-work-item`** and the relevant atomic skill.

## What to check

- Scope and goal are clear.
- Work is broken down into manageable items; anything estimated at 5+ points should be considered for splitting.
- Acceptance criteria and dependencies are known enough for estimation.
- Estimation technique is explicit: planning poker, T-shirt sizing, Fibonacci, or the team override.
- Capacity considers availability, holidays, meetings, focus factor, dependencies, and historical velocity.
