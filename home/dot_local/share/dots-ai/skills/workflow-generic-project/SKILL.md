# Workflow — Generic Project (WHAT)

**All skill instructions, ticket comments, and PR text must be in English.**

## Delegation (HOW lives in tool skills)

| Need | Delegate to |
| --- | --- |
| ClickUp tasks, comments, status | **clickup-cli** |
| Jira issue ops, comments, dev links | External **jira-*** skills (e.g. via **jira-assistant** router; CLI: `jira-as`) per repo docs |
| Confluence pages, search | External **confluence-*** skills (e.g. via **confluence-assistant** router; CLI: `confluence-as`) per repo docs |
| Draft PR on GitHub after push | **github-cli-workflow** |
| Draft MR on GitLab after push | **gitlab-cli-workflow** |
| Repository discovery and conflicts | **dots-ai-assistant** |

Do **not** paste forge or ticket CLI sequences here; open the tool skill and follow it.

## Principles

1. **Context:** Pull Jira, ClickUp, Confluence, and linked docs the task references; treat them as source of truth with the codebase (**dots-ai-assistant** inspection order).
2. **Repo standards:** Follow `AGENTS.md`, CONTRIBUTING, PR templates, and documented Docker or devcontainer flows.
3. **Human in the loop:** Confirm understanding and plan **before** substantial implementation; get explicit approval **before** finalizing PR text; escalate when context is missing.
4. **Validation first:** Align on acceptance criteria and approach before deep implementation.
5. **Traceability:** Add concise English comments on the **original** Jira issue or ClickUp task for plan approval, meaningful milestones, and PR link—no duplicate full PR bodies in tickets.

## Phases (gates)

1. **Intake:** Identify ticket IDs; retrieve linked docs via appropriate skills.
2. **Discovery:** Analyze repo per **dots-ai-assistant**; note CI, templates, dev environments.
3. **Plan:** Written plan → **stop for user approval.** No implementation until approved.
4. **Plan traceability:** After plan approval, post a short ticket comment (delegate comment mechanism to **clickup-cli**, **jira-*** or **confluence-*** as applicable).
5. **Implement:** Work in logical commits per repo conventions; self-review.
6. **Push and draft PR/MR:** Push branch, then invoke **github-cli-workflow** or **gitlab-cli-workflow** for a **draft**; confirm title/body with the user.
7. **Close loop:** Post final short ticket comment with PR link (via same ticket skills as above).

## Branch naming (intent)

Prefer **`<short-username>/<WORK_ITEM_ID>-<short-slug>`** (lowercase). Resolve username per repo or user preference; base branch per repo default (**main**, **develop**, etc.).

## Session override

If the user requests **local-only** work: skip push/PR automation; note limitations in ticket updates if still posting.

## Safety

- Never commit secrets; no force-push to shared defaults unless the user explicitly requests recovery steps.
